# Astro Multi-Framework Architecture Guide

## Overview

You've built a sophisticated Astro application with SolidJS, Qwik, Svelte, and SPA capabilities. This guide will help you make optimal architectural decisions for performance, cost-efficiency, and user experience.

## Decision Framework

### 1. SSG vs SSR Decision Tree

**Use SSG (Static Site Generation) for:**
- Marketing pages, blogs, documentation
- Content that changes weekly/monthly or less
- SEO-critical pages
- Pages where CloudFlare costs matter
- Landing pages and company info

**Use SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for:**
- User dashboards with personalized content
- Real-time data that changes frequently
- Pages requiring authentication
- Dynamic content based on user location/preferences
- When you need fresh data on every request

**Cost Consideration:** SSG = Free, SSR = CloudFlare Function costs

### 2. Client Islands vs Server Islands

#### Client Islands
**Best for:**
- Simple, stateless interactions (toggles, modals, accordions)
- Components that don't need server data
- Quick interactions that should feel instant
- Small bundle size components

**Frameworks to use:**
- **Qwik**: Perfect for client islands - minimal JS, resumable
- **SolidJS**: Great for performance-critical client interactions
- **Svelte**: Good for simple, lightweight interactions

```astro
<!-- Example: Simple client-side toggle -->
<QwikThemeToggle client:load />
<SolidModal client:visible />
<SvelteAccordion client:idle />
```

#### Server Islands
**Best for:**
- Components that need fresh data
- Heavy, complex interactions
- Components that benefit from caching
- Expensive computations
- Components that change frequently but can be cached

**Primary framework choice:**
- **Qwik**: Ideal for server islands - resumable, minimal hydration

```astro
<!-- Example: Cached server-rendered component -->
<QwikUserDashboard server:defer />
<QwikDataVisualization server:defer />
```

### 3. Framework Selection Guide

#### Qwik - The Server Islands Champion
**Use Qwik for:**
- Server islands (primary use case)
- Complex components that need server data
- Performance-critical interactions
- Components where bundle size matters most

**Why Qwik excels here:**
- Resumability means minimal JS sent to client
- Perfect for server islands with cached rendering
- Best-in-class hydration performance

#### SolidJS - The Performance Beast
**Use SolidJS for:**
- Complex client-side state management
- Performance-critical client interactions
- Data-heavy components that stay client-side
- Your SPA sections

**Why SolidJS excels here:**
- Fastest runtime performance
- Excellent for complex state
- Great TypeScript support
- Perfect for SPAs

#### Svelte - The Simple Choice
**Use Svelte for:**
- Simple, lightweight interactions
- Animations and transitions
- Quick prototyping
- Components where developer experience matters

**Why Svelte excels here:**
- Smallest bundle sizes
- Simplest syntax
- Great for simple interactions
- Excellent animations

### 4. SPA vs Multi-Page Architecture

#### Use SPA Pattern (`/spa/[...all].astro`) for:

**Application-like sections:**
- User dashboards
- Admin panels
- Complex workflows (multi-step forms, editors)
- Real-time collaborative tools
- Data visualization interfaces

**SPA Implementation:**
```astro
---
// /spa/[...all].astro
---
<SolidSPARouter client:only="solid-js" />
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant navigation between app pages
- Persistent state across routes
- Better UX for application workflows
- Can use complex state management

#### Use Traditional Astro for:

**Website-like sections:**
- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- Documentation
- Product pages
- Company information

**Benefits:**
- Better SEO
- Faster initial loads
- Lower CloudFlare costs
- Better accessibility by default

### 5. Recommended Architecture Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Marketing Site + App Dashboard
```
/                    → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)
/about              → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)  
/blog/[...slug]     → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)
/pricing            → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)
/app/[...all]       → SPA (SolidJS) with SSR for auth
/admin/[...all]     → SPA (SolidJS) with SSR for auth
```

#### Pattern 2: Documentation + Interactive Tools
```
/                   → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)
/docs/[...slug]     → SSG + Client Islands (Qwik/Svelte)
/tools/[...all]     → SPA (SolidJS) for complex interactions
/api/*              → SSR for dynamic data
```

#### Pattern 3: E-commerce + User Portal
```
/                   → SSG + Server Islands (Qwik for product data)
/products/[id]      → SSR + Server Islands (Qwik for inventory)
/cart               → SSR + Client Islands (SolidJS for complex state)
/account/[...all]   → SPA (SolidJS) for account management
```

### 6. Performance Optimization Strategy

#### Bundle Splitting Strategy
1. **Static pages**: Minimal JS, mainly Qwik/Svelte client islands
2. **Dynamic pages**: Server islands (Qwik) + minimal client JS
3. **SPA sections**: Full SolidJS with code splitting

#### Caching Strategy
```astro
---
// Heavy computation in server islands
---
<QwikExpensiveChart server:defer cache:time="1h" />
<QwikUserData server:defer cache:user="30m" />
```

#### Progressive Enhancement
1. Start with SSG + basic HTML
2. Add client islands for interactivity
3. Upgrade to server islands for dynamic data
4. Use SPA only for complex application flows

### 7. Development Workflow

#### File Organization
```
src/
├── components-qwik/     # Server islands + light client islands
├── components-solid/    # SPAs + complex client state
├── components-svelte/   # Simple client islands
├── pages/
│   ├── index.astro     # Static marketing
│   ├── blog/           # Static content
│   ├── app/            # SPA sections
│   └── api/            # SSR endpoints
└── spa/
    ├── solid-apps/     # SPA implementations
    └── routing/        # SPA routers
```

#### Component Decision Flowchart
```
New Component Needed
│
├─ Does it need server data or heavy computation?
│  ├─ Yes → Server Island (Qwik)
│  └─ No → Continue...
│
├─ Is it part of an application workflow?
│  ├─ Yes → SPA Component (SolidJS)
│  └─ No → Continue...
│
├─ Does it have complex state or interactions?
│  ├─ Yes → Client Island (SolidJS)
│  └─ No → Client Island (Svelte or Qwik)
```
